# Noise-Model-Simulation-of-QKD-Protocols-using-QSim
The major objective of this proposal is to carry out comparative evaluation of quantum key distribution protocols in noisy environment of quantum computing. In order to do this, this research presents the simulation of two QKD protocols, such as, BB84 and Differential Phase Shift (DPS), in two different simulators, QASM [IBM Quantum Lab] and QSim [IISC Bangalore and IIT Roorkee] varying qubits.
	•	This Project work implemented and presented simulation results of two QKD protocols, such as, BB84 and DPS in ideal case. 
	•	This Project work implemented bit flip and depolarization in qiskit followed by simulation in QASM, using qiskit runtime on IBM cloud.
	•	Next, this Project work also implemented bit flip and depolarization and executed the simulation in CPU based simulator QSim through proper job submission in quantum computing workbench [IISC Bangalore and IIT Roorkee].
	
 	This Project implemented following cases in QASM and QSim for BB84 and DPS respectively:
	•	Case Study -I: Simulation of Ideal QKD Protocols 
	•	Case Study -II: Simulation of QKD Protocols with 10% Bit Flip noise
	•	Case Study -III: Simulation of QKD Protocols with 70% Depolarization noise 
Due to facing difficulties in QSim portal for execution of codes in QSim, all the programs are not commented. As we need to execute on trial basis. 
However, for each specific JobID, the codes are commented and saved as python file respectively.
